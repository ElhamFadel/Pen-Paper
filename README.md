# Pen-Paper
A simple blogging platform where users can create accounts, write and publish their own blog posts, and view other user's posts. The backend would be built using NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework, and the frontend would be built using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Some features that could be included in the project are:

- [ ] User authentication and authorization
- [ ] Creating, editing, and deleting blog posts
- [ ] Adding comments to blog posts
- [ ] A simple search feature for finding specific posts
- [ ] Ability for users to follow other users and view their posts on a personalized feed
